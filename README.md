# ForgetMeChunk

ForgetMeChunk is a simple client side mod that removes a type of light update when unloading chunks.
This fixes the large lag spikes you sometimes get when crossing a chunk border.

It is unlikely that this would cause any issues, however any issues it does cause would be client side only and fixed by reloading the affected chunks.

However use at your own risk.
